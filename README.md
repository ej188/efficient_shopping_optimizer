# Efficient Shopping Optimizer ðŸ›’

## Overview

This project is a data-driven attempt to optimize grocery purchases for individuals who are both health-conscious and budget-aware. As someone who deeply values efficiency in both time and spending, I wanted to explore how computational methodsâ€”particularly **optimization algorithms**â€”can help us make better decisions in our everyday lives.

## Objective

Build a simple but effective tool that helps users select the best combination of grocery items under a fixed budget, **maximizing nutritional value** while minimizing cost.  
The project reflects my own dietary goals: protein-focused, clean eating, with minimal reliance on processed snacks.

## Problem Definition

Many grocery shoppers struggle to balance nutrition with affordability. For someone following a specific meal plan, it's often unclear which combination of items gives the best value for money while meeting dietary goals.

This project formulates the problem as a **0-1 Knapsack Optimization Problem**:
- Each food item has:
  - a **cost** (price per unit),
  - a **value** (e.g. grams of protein),
  - and a **category** (protein, carb, vegetable, etc.).
- The goal is to **maximize total nutritional value** (e.g. total protein intake) while staying within a budget.

## My Role and Motivation

As someone driven by efficiency in both time and cost, I wanted to quantify and automate decisions I used to make intuitively. This project bridges my background in **mathematics, statistics, and data science** with my personal interest in health and finance.

## Optimization Focus

The model can be customized to optimize for different nutritional goals or combinations such as:
- **Protein per dollar** (primary focus)
- **Fiber per dollar**
- **Calories per dollar**
- Or a weighted scoring system (e.g. 70% protein, 30% fiber)

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**: Nutritional efficiency is measured per 100g, which may over- or underrepresent foods typically consumed in smaller or larger portions. Future work may adjust for realistic serving sizes to refine scoring metrics.
> ðŸ“Œ **Protein Requirement Note**: The optimizer does not currently enforce a minimum protein threshold. However, a future interactive version may allow users to input their own body weight and activity level, calculating an individualized protein goal (e.g. 1.6â€“2.2g/kg body weight for active individuals).
> ðŸ“ˆ `protein_density` is scaled by 100 for readability and relative comparison. A density of 0.25 means 25g of protein per 100 kcal.

## Algorithm

The problem is solved using the **0-1 Knapsack algorithm**, which is suitable for binary decisions (either include the item or not).  
In future iterations, extensions like the **bounded knapsack** or **multi-objective optimization** can be applied.

## Next Steps

- Refine dataset (realistic prices, nutritional info, serving sizes)
- Implement optimization model
- Build UI or CLI to make the tool interactive

## Results

The final optimizer produces a budget-friendly and protein-rich shopping list that:

- Respects a fixed budget (e.g. **$120**)
- Satisfies nutritional constraints (e.g. **â‰¥3500g protein/month**)
- Avoids monotony (e.g. no more than 4 of the same item)
- Ensures diversity (e.g. â‰¥2 protein sources, â‰¥1 vegetable, â‰¥1 fruit)

**Example Output (Store â†’ Category â†’ Item):**

```
ALDI:
  protein:
    - Chicken Breast x2 | $9.98 | Score: 38.2
    - Salmon Fillet x1  | $7.49 | Score: 26.4
  vegetables:
    - Carrot x1         | $1.29 | Score: 4.3
...

ðŸ’µ Total Cost: $119.82  
ðŸ’ª Total Weighted Protein Score: 183.5
```
